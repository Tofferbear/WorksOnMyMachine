# ToffersTunes ðŸŽ§

This app fetches my last *n* Spotify plays, because memory is fickle and playlists are forever.

Built to scratch a personal itch (and maybe yours too), **ToffersTunes** gives you quick access to your most recently streamed tracks. Whether you're cataloging your listening habits, building a personalized archive, or just trying to remember what was stuck in your head last Tuesdayâ€”this app has your back.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Retrieves the last **n** Spotify track plays
- Outputs artist name, track title, and timestamp

- Designed to be snark-free, but thatâ€™s a moving target

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run it locally:
1) build it
2) have the dotnet cli installed
3) start by typing "func start"
4) in the output there will be a URL to click in order to get the auth token
