# Trackify ðŸ“ŠðŸŽ¶

Because if youâ€™re going to obsess over your Spotify play history, you might as well do it with charts.

**Trackify** is a React-based app that parses your historical Spotify plays JSON and turns it into sortable tables, juicy graphs, and data insights you didnâ€™t know you needed. Perfect for music nerds, data tinkerers, and those trying to justify their 3AM ska binge.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does
- Parses Spotify historic play JSON exports
- Displays track, artist, and timestamp data
- Visualizes trends over time via charts and graphs
- Lets you sort, filter, and marvel at your own listening habits

## ðŸš€ Running Locally
1) npm install
2) npm start

## You'll need:
- Your Spotify JSON export (usually from a GDPR download or custom scrape)
- A basic respect for music data hygiene

## ðŸ“¦ Stack
- React + Chart.js
- CSS with a hint of chaos
- D3 (if you're brave)

## ðŸ¤“ Use Cases
- Discover when your taste peaked (or plummeted)
- Build timelines of questionable playlists
- Correlate life events with audio choices
- Feed your inner analyst without opening Excel

## â˜• About the Dev
Made by a backend wrangler dipping into the frontend poolâ€”with graph envy, playlist nostalgia, and just enough caffeine to chart anything that moves
