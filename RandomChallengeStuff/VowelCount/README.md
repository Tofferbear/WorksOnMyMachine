# 🗣️ Vowel Count

This challenge reads a line of text from standard input, counts how many vowels it contains, and prints the total. Simple, right? Unless you're one of those people who can't decide if "y" is a vowel.

## 🧠 Problem Description

Read **one** line from stdin. Count the number of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) regardless of case. Output the total as a single integer.

### ✅ Requirements
- Input: A single line of ASCII text
- Output: An integer representing the number of vowels
- Case insensitive (i.e., 'A' and 'a' both count)
- Ignore non-letter characters

## 📥 Input Example
Hello, World!


## 📤 Output Example
3

(Explanation: 1 × `e`, 1 × `o`, 1 × `o` = 3 vowels)
