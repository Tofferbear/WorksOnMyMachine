# ðŸ”„ Reverse FizzBuzz (C#)

What happens when you ask `int.MaxValue` to count down all the way to 1 like a caffeinated kindergarten teacher playing FizzBuzz backwards? This project answers that questionâ€”one modulo operation at a time.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

Prints output for every number from `int.MaxValue` down to `1`:

- `"FizzBuzz"` if divisible by **15**
- `"Fizz"` if divisible by **3**
- `"Buzz"` if divisible by **5**
- Otherwise, just prints the number

All of itâ€”without skipping, cheating, or mercy.
