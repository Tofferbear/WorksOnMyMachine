# 🔍 First Non-Repeating Character

Reads a line of text from stdin and finds the first character that appears **exactly once**. Outputs it. Otherwise? Silence.

## 📘 Problem Description

Given one line of text:
- Find the first character (from **left to right**) that occurs **only once**
- Output that character
- Case-sensitive: `'A'` and `'a'` are different
- If every character repeats, print **nothing**

## ✅ Requirements
- Input: A single line of ASCII text
- Output: One character OR empty output
- Maintain original order
- Preserve case sensitivity

## 📥 Input Examples
swiss


## 📤 Output Examples
w

(Explanation: `'S'` repeats, `'w'` is the first unique)
