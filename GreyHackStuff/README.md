# GreyHackStuff 🧠🔐

A tribute to the moment I nearly disappeared into the matrix.

This repo contains my early foray into scripting for **Grey Hack**, the sandbox hacking simulation game that’s part cybersecurity puzzler, part digital rabbit hole. The code here reflects the ideas and logic I felt proud of—until I realized mastery required full-time cognitive residency inside this universe.

## 🎯 What’s Inside
- Scripts written in **GreyScript**, Grey Hack’s custom language
- Tools and utilities for system discovery, file manipulation, and network trickery
- Functional patterns I pieced together through trial, error, and inevitable compromise

## 🛠 Requirements
To view, edit, or deploy these scripts into Grey Hack:
- 🧩 [GreyScript Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=greyscript.greyscript)
- 💻 Visual Studio Code (obviously)
- 🎮 A copy of Grey Hack
- 🧠 Optional: Willingness to sacrifice evenings to fine-tune recursive grep functions

## ⚠️ Caveats & Wisdom
- This code worked great...at the time. Future Grey Hack updates may break functionality or shift APIs.
- I chose not to pursue deeper perfection because I like having other hobbies. Like sleep. Or talking to humans.
- Some scripts may be commented like I was about to finish a thought—because I was.

## 💭 Why I Shared This
There’s something strangely beautiful about solving digital problems inside a simulated OS. Even if I didn’t chase full mastery, I left behind a few breadcrumbs for those who want to.

If you’re venturing into Grey Hack and want starter inspiration, code snippets, or reminders that you’re not the only one spiraling down syscalls—welcome.
