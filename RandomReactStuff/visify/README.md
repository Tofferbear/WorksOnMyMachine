# Visify 🔊✨

Real-time audio visualization, right from your system's sound output. No cables. No config. Just vibes.

**Visify** is a React-based web app that taps into your default sound device and transforms whatever you’re listening to into flowing, pulsing, data-driven eye candy. Music, podcasts, existential YouTube rants—if it makes noise, Visify makes it visual.

## 🎯 What It Does
- Captures audio from your system’s default output device
- Renders reactive visuals in-browser using Web Audio API
- Supports waveform, frequency, and custom visual modes
- Runs entirely client-side—no recording, no storage

## 🚀 Getting Started
npm install
npm start

Then kick off your favorite playlist and open the app. Boom—your screen becomes a party.

## Requirements
- Chrome or other browser that supports getUserMedia for audio input
- Desktop OS with loopback permissions (macOS, Windows, etc.)
- Headphones optional, but encouraged

## 📦 Stack
- React + Web Audio API
- Canvas & SVG wizardry
- Hooks and rhythm in equal measure

## 💡 Use Cases
- Turn any browser into a music visualizer
- Ambient display for streamers or DJs
- React demo that actually feels alive
- Testing your speakers and your vibe

## ⚠️ Notes
- Not built for mobile (yet)
- Requires loopback audio access—some systems may need extra permissions
- Visual quality may depend on coffee intake and soundcard integrity

## ☕ About the Dev
Built by a backend engineer letting loose on the frontend—because sometimes the best way to appreciate audio is to stare at squiggly lines.
