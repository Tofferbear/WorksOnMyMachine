# WorksOnMyMachine 🛠️

Welcome to the personal museum of code artifacts I swear looked impressive when I wrote them. This repo showcases a curated selection of my development work—spanning backend wizardry, cloud chaos, algorithmic deep-dives, and the occasional modding mischief.

Some of these projects were born from curiosity, others from necessity, and a few from sheer stubbornness. You'll find everything from polished patterns to beautifully eccentric edge cases.

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- C# experiments and microservice patterns
- Cloud architecture samples (Azure, AWS)
- Game modding tangents (Minecraft, BitBurner, Grey Hat)
- Algorithms and data structure explorations
- Possibly a rogue Spotify mining app or two

## 📦 Disclaimer
The finished stuff runs flawlessly on my machine. Your mileage may vary.  :P
