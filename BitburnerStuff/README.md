# BitburnerScripts ðŸ§ ðŸ’¾

Automating my empire, one script at a time.

This repo contains scripts I've written for **Bitburner**, the incremental hacking RPG where JavaScript meets cybercrime... kind of. These scripts reflect the trials, triumphs, and occasional typos of building a digital dynasty inside a fictional OS.

Unlike Grey Hack, Bitburner doesnâ€™t ask for your sanityâ€”just your CPU cycles and obsession with optimization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s Inside
- `hack.js`, `grow.js`, and other classics remixed
- Stock market automation attempts (some smarter than others)
- Server mapping, port cracking, and root-spreading routines
- Corp and gang management helpers, because capitalism needs scripts too

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- **Bitburner** installed on Steam or browser
- **Visual Studio Code** (optional but ideal)
- An appreciation for scripting your way to digital omnipotence

## ðŸš€ Deploying Scripts
Simply copy `.js` files into Bitburner's in-game terminal or sync via external editor.

## ðŸ§ª Notes
- Most scripts follow vanilla Bitburner APIsâ€”no fancy RAM-saving tricks (yet).
- Some are unfinished or purely experimental. It's a sandbox, not a product launch.
- Not battle-tested for post-singularity gameplay. You're on your own past that point.

## â˜• About the Dev
Backend engineer by trade, pretend-hacker by hobby. Still playing Bitburner because it scratches the scripting itch without requiring me to become one with the machine.
